Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise is built on the Azure Bot Service. Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage your Cortana Skill. Azure AD manages building, testing, and deploying within the tenant.  

*   Azure Bot Service   
    A skill is a speech bot. Use the Bot Framework to build your speech bot, register your speech bot, and define your Cortana channel. The framework provides a .NET SDK and a Node.js SDK for you to build your bot. The Bot Framework SDKs provide features, such as dialogs and built-in prompts, that make interacting with users simpler.  
    *    Visit Azure Bot Service page located at [azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service).  

*   Azure Active Directory  
    Azure AD helps enterprises manage user identities and create intelligence-driven access policies to secure your resources. The Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise uses the same technology to deploy custom Cortana Skills to a group of Azure AD users. The group of Azure AD users test or manage deployment to the entire tenant.  
    *   Visit the Azure AD page located at [azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory).

*   IT Admin Portal for managing Cortana Skill deployment to tenant  
    A dedicated portal for IT Administrators and delegated reviewers. Review the Cortana Skills submitted by enterprise developers for deployment to tenant. Verify that your Cortana Skill follows the Microsoft guidelines before approving for deployment.  
    Microsoft provides the following guideline categories.  
    *   Privacy  
    *   Security  
    *   Other practices for success
