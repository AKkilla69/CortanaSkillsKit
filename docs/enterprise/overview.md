Cortana is a digital assistant that keeps users informed and productive, helping them get things done throughout the day. With Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise, you are now able to extend the capabilities of Cortana by building your own custom skills for domains ranging from HR, IT, Helpdesk, and Sales to areas like Smart Building.  

*   Retrieval information more easily  
*   Complete tasks and workflows easier with voice  
*   Save time and focus on things that matter most  

Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise is built on top of Azure Bot Service and uses Azure Active Directory to manage building, testing, and deployment of the custom skills within the tenant.  

*   Azure Bot Service   
    A skill is a speech bot. Use the Bot Framework to build your speech bot, register your speech bot, and define your Cortana channel. The framework provides a .NET SDK and a Node.js SDK for you to build your bot. The Bot Framework SDKs provide features, such as dialogs and built-in prompts, that make interacting with users simpler.  
    *    For an overview of how the framework works, visit the [How the Bot Framework works](https://docs.microsoft.com/bot-framework/overview-how-bot-framework-works) page.  

*   Azure Active Directory  
    Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) helps enterprises manage user identities and create intelligence-driven access policies to secure your resources. The Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise leverages the same technology to deploy custom skills to a group of Azure AD users for testing and to manage deployment to the entire tenant.  

*   IT Admin Portal for managing skill deployment to tenant  
    Dedicated portal for IT Administrators and delegated reviewers to review the skills submitted by enterprise developers for deployment to tenant. Reviewers should ensure that custom skills follow Microsoft guidelines on privacy, security and other best practices before approving a skill for tenant deployment.
