# Test Your Cortana Skill

    3.  *   If you are creating a new group, then click on the **Create Group** button.

*   Team members use your Cortana Skill by launching Cortana on Windows 10 and saying `Hey Cortana, ask <invocation_name>`.  
*   Send an email message to your group to notify them of their access and ask for feedback.

    > I'd like you to test my `<name>` Cortana Skill and have granted you access.  
    > You may invoke the Cortana Skill on Windows 10 by saying `Hey Cortana, ask <invocation_phrase>`.  
    > Try these phrases `<list_of_things_to_test>` and please send me feedback.
